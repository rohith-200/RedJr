ðŸ“¦ **Project Overview**

This project is a student-to-student marketplace built for and by SFSU students. It enables users to seamlessly register, post item listings, browse products by category, and communicate with sellers through an integrated messaging system. Designed to foster a local campus-based exchange network, the platform includes features such as search ranking for relevant results, image handling for product listings, profile views, listing confirmations, and email verification. The UI is styled with custom CSS for a clean and responsive experience, tailored to the needs of the SFSU community.
